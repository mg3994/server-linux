# Multi-Vendor Delivery Server Enhancement Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for enhancing and completing a high-performance HTTP/3 multi-vendor delivery server built with Rust. The system will support real-time order management, Firebase authentication, push notifications, and payment processing for a food delivery platform similar to Uber Eats, DoorDash, or Zomato.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: HTTP/3 Server Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a high-performance HTTP/3 server that can handle concurrent connections efficiently, so that the platform can scale to support thousands of simultaneous users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server starts THEN it SHALL establish a Quinn-based HTTP/3 endpoint with proper TLS configuration
2. WHEN a client connects THEN the server SHALL handle QUIC connections and convert them to H3 requests
3. WHEN multiple requests arrive simultaneously THEN the server SHALL process them concurrently using Tokio async runtime
4. IF TLS certificates are missing THEN the server SHALL generate self-signed certificates for development
5. WHEN the server receives an HTTP/3 request THEN it SHALL properly route it through the Axum middleware stack

### Requirement 2: Firebase Authentication System

**User Story:** As a mobile app user, I want to authenticate using Google, Apple, email, or phone number, so that I can securely access the delivery platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides a Firebase ID token THEN the server SHALL verify it against Google's public keys
2. WHEN token verification succeeds THEN the server SHALL extract user information and validate requirements
3. WHEN a user first registers or logs in THEN the system SHALL verify both email AND phone number before allowing access
4. WHEN authentication succeeds THEN the server SHALL add user context to the request for downstream handlers
5. WHEN a token is expired or invalid THEN the server SHALL return a 401 Unauthorized response

### Requirement 3: Push Notification Service

**User Story:** As a customer, restaurant owner, or delivery person, I want to receive real-time notifications about order updates, so that I can track order progress and take appropriate actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the FCM service initializes THEN it SHALL authenticate using Firebase service account credentials
2. WHEN sending notifications THEN the service SHALL use OAuth 2.0 JWT bearer tokens instead of deprecated server keys
3. WHEN an order status changes THEN the system SHALL send customized notifications to relevant stakeholders
4. IF notification delivery fails THEN the system SHALL log the error but continue processing other notifications
5. WHEN sending bulk notifications THEN the service SHALL process them concurrently for optimal performance

### Requirement 4: Order Management System

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to place orders, track their status, and receive updates throughout the delivery process, so that I know when to expect my food.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a customer places an order THEN the system SHALL create an order record with unique ID and timestamp
2. WHEN an order is created THEN the system SHALL notify both customer and restaurant immediately
3. WHEN restaurant accepts an order THEN the system SHALL assign a delivery person and notify them of the pickup details
3. WHEN restaurant updates order status THEN the system SHALL notify relevant parties based on the status change
4. IF order status is "Ready" THEN the system SHALL notify both customer and assigned delivery person
5. WHEN order is delivered THEN the system SHALL send final confirmation to the customer

### Requirement 5: Payment Processing Framework

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to securely process payments for my orders, so that I can complete transactions safely and efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a payment is initiated THEN the system SHALL validate the user's authentication and order details
2. WHEN processing payments THEN the system SHALL integrate with Google Pay UPI-based payment system
3. IF payment fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages and maintain transaction logs
4. WHEN payment succeeds THEN the system SHALL update order status and trigger confirmation notifications
5. WHEN order issues occur (rejection, cancellation, etc.) THEN the system SHALL automatically process refunds through UPI
6. WHEN retrieving payment details THEN the system SHALL ensure users can only access their own payment information

### Requirement 6: Database Integration Layer

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a flexible database abstraction layer, so that the system can work with different database backends (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.).

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the database service initializes THEN it SHALL establish connections based on configuration
2. WHEN performing CRUD operations THEN the service SHALL provide async methods for all database interactions
3. IF database connection fails THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
4. WHEN handling concurrent requests THEN the database pool SHALL manage connections efficiently
5. WHEN migrating data THEN the system SHALL provide schema migration utilities

### Requirement 7: User Management Service

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want comprehensive user management capabilities, so that I can manage customers, restaurants, and delivery personnel effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user registers THEN the system SHALL create user profiles with role-based permissions
2. WHEN user data is updated THEN the system SHALL validate changes and maintain audit logs
3. IF user verification is required THEN the system SHALL integrate with Firebase Auth verification flows
4. WHEN retrieving user data THEN the system SHALL respect privacy settings and role-based access controls
5. WHEN users are deactivated THEN the system SHALL handle cleanup of associated data appropriately

### Requirement 8: Restaurant Management Service

**User Story:** As a restaurant owner, I want to manage my menu, orders, and business settings, so that I can operate my delivery business efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN restaurants register THEN the system SHALL create restaurant profiles with menu management capabilities
2. WHEN menu items are updated THEN the system SHALL validate pricing and availability information
3. IF orders are received THEN restaurants SHALL be able to accept, reject, or modify estimated preparation times
4. WHEN restaurant status changes THEN the system SHALL update availability for new orders
5. WHEN generating reports THEN restaurants SHALL access their order history and analytics

### Requirement 9: Delivery Management Service

**User Story:** As a delivery person, I want to receive delivery assignments and update delivery status, so that I can efficiently complete deliveries and earn income.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN delivery persons are available THEN the system SHALL assign orders based on proximity and capacity
2. WHEN delivery status updates THEN the system SHALL track real-time location and estimated arrival times
3. IF delivery issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide communication channels between all parties
4. WHEN deliveries are completed THEN the system SHALL process payment settlements and ratings
5. WHEN generating earnings reports THEN delivery persons SHALL access their completed delivery history

### Requirement 10: Location Tracking and User Experience

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to track my order location and see delivery progress in real-time, so that I know exactly when my food will arrive and where my delivery person is.

#### Acceptance Criteria
